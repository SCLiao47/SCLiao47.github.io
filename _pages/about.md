## Welcome!

My name is Shih-Chi Liao (given name pronounced like "Shee-Chee"). I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. This website is the place to share my work and engage with you! If you find anything interesting or resonating, feel free to reach out. I'd love to meet you! 

## My research

My research interests broadly cover control theory, optimization, and robotics. With my advisor Prof. [Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu/), we are **developing methods and tools to enhance and certify the safety and reliability of complex dynamical systems**. To be more precise, I work on methods to analyze the stability and performance of Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) of fluid flows. Our methods aim to provide verification on dynamical behaviors and critical scenarios for further testing on high-fidelity models.

Currently, my research focuses on bridging data-driven methods and robust control techniques to certify the stability of fluid flows. Our methods can also be used to analyze other complex nonlinear system such as neural networks. You can find my previous works [here](/publications/), which includes ensuring safety of systems under uncertainties using Robust Control Barrier Function (RCBF) and computing Region of Attraction (ROA) of nonlinear systems using Quadratic Constraints. 

## A bit more about me
Before starting the Ph.D. program in January 2021, I received a Master of Robotics at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in December 2020 and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering at National Taiwan University in January 2019. During that time, I built a few robots, broke them, and tried to make them work again. 

Besides doing research and watching robot videos, I also enjoy hiking, surfing, and reading. Currently, I'm building a habit to run!
