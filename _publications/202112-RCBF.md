## Abstract
This letter focuses on safety-critical control with sector-bounded uncertainties at the plant input. The uncertainties can represent nonlinear and/or time-varying components. We propose a new robust control barrier function (RCBF) approach to enforce safety requirements in the presence of these uncertainties. The primary objective is to minimally alter the given baseline control command to guarantee safety in the presence of modeled uncertainty. The resulting min-norm optimization problem can be recast as a Second-Order Cone Program (SOCP) to enable online implementation. Properties of this controller are studied, and a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.
